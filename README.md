# Actions on Google Resources

## Intent
The intent of this repo is to provide resources to get started creating Actions on Google. It is meant to be supplemental, and the resources should not be used in place of the official [Actions on Google Documentation](https://developers.google.com/actions/?gclid=CjwKEAjw4IjKBRDr6p752cCUm3kSJAC-eqRtgAyqQJG1GDSEOJ204yZZGL4bGDKVQ4YjWdFs0kWYTRoCLhbw_wcB).

Would you rather view this repo as a webpage? If so, checkout out the [gh-page](https://khowen.github.io/actions-on-google-resources/).
